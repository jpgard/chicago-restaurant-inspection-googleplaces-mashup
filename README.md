# Chicago Restaurant Inspection/Google Places Mashup

This project (currently in progress) utilizes the Restaurant Inspection dataset obtained from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/ and data obtained from Google APIs including user reviews, restaurant data, and other information to explore the relationship between open user-generated content and health inspection outcomes.

The script requires the "Food Inspections" dataset, available at the URL above, and a Google Places API Key (note: get_data.py, which obtains Google data for the restaurants, may take several hours to run as it obtains reviews and other data for approximately 100,000 restaurants. The limit for free usage as of 2/14/2016 is 150,000 requests per 24 hour period). 

All scripts were developed by Josh Gardner. To see more examples of my work or to contact me regarding additional projects, visit my portfolio site at http://www.jpgard.com.
