# Chicago Restaurant Inspection/Google Places Mashup

This project (currently in progress) utilizes the Restaurant Inspection dataset obtained from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/ and data obtained from Google APIs including user reviews, restaurant data, and other information to explore the relationship between open user-generated content and health inspection outcomes. Specifically, the analysis looks at various features related to profile completeness and natural language features of user-generated reviews (length, sentiment) to analyze their relationship to health inspection outcomes. Just for fun, the script also provides a function to extract the "maximum" sentiment reviews based on specified length parameters and the term frequency-inverse document frequency scores for terms within each inspection outcome category.

The script requires the "Food Inspections" dataset, available at the URL above, and a Google Places API Key (note: get_data.py, which obtains Google data for the restaurants, may take several hours to run as it obtains reviews and other data for approximately 120,000 restaurants. The limit for free usage as of 2/14/2016 is 150,000 requests per 24 hour period; but the text search API requests used in this script are subject to a 10x multiplier). More information about API keys and usage limits is available at https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/usage. 

All scripts were developed by Josh Gardner. To see more examples of my work or to contact me regarding additional projects, visit my site at http://www.jpgard.com.
